### Instructions
1. Download the `Setup.exe` from [latest Release](https://github.com/ebiggz/ph-discord-activity-overlay/releases/latest).
2. Run setup (you might get notifications telling you the file is from an unknown publisher, run anyway)
3. After app installs, you'll see a red potion icon in the tray. Right click it to see options.
4. Click "Show Overlay URL" and copy the url into a Browser Source in OBS. Make sure browser source dimensions match the canvas size (ie 1280 x 720)
5. Done!
> Note: App must be running for overlay to function. App will automatically start when Windows does so you don't have to worry about it.

### Dev

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`
